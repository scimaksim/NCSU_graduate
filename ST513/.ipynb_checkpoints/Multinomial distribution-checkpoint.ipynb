    "**$Q_{3}$:** Suppose the probability that it rains on Saturday is 0.25 and the probability that it rains on Sunday is 0.25.  The probability that it rains on the weekend is then $P(\\text{Rain on Sunday OR Rain on Saturday}) = P(\\text{Rain on Sunday}) + P(\\text{Rain on Saturday}) – P(\\text{Rain on Saturday AND Rain on Sunday})$. \n",
    "\n",
    "**$A_{3}$:** No – this would only be the case if $P(\\text{Rain on Saturday AND Rain on Sunday}) = P(\\text{Rain on Saturday})P(\\text{Rain on Sunday})$.  This would be true if it raining on Saturday was independent of it raining on Sunday.  This is highly unlikely.  Many times there are storms that can last multiple days.  This means that knowing it is raining on Saturday may change our probabilities associated with it raining on Sunday. \n",

    "**$Q_{5}$:** How does the multiplication law/rule <br>$P(A \\cap B) = P(A)P(B)$ apply to joint distributions from a random sample?\n",
    "\n",
    "**$A_{5}$:** Similar to the multiplication law/rule, the joint distribution of $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ can be written as $f(y_1,y_2) = f(y_1)f(y_2)$.  This will be really important when we start looking at maximum likelihood!"
